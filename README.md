# day6

Simple RaphaelJS dropdown menu, since I found it difficult to look up the API, so I would develop a simple Raphael dictionary myself tomorrow on day7.

The really cool thing today I did is that I found a way to display the code on the left and show the code on the right side of the page.
I would definitely continue to use this format before a better one came to me.
